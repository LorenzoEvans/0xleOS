            for a bit of disappointment, this is probably not the article for you.

        Now, this isn't a comprehensive writeup of the entirety of the field of topology,
        just a definition of the word, and also, 
        <i>topological deformations, such as gluing and tearing
        </i>
        and what they mean, so that you can keep your conceptual orientation the next time you stumble upon this term, and the adjacent ones.

            Before we break this topic down, we should get our bearings.

            One can think of topology as a tool, in the same toolbox as geometry, a study concerned with
            the nature of shape, size, quantity, and space. When it comes to comparing the two however, what particularly concerns us, is 
            <i>
                surfaces
            </i>.
            Given two shapes, say a square, and a rhombus, when we talk about, contrast or examine the topology of these, sometimes in comparison to their geometry,
            we are speaking of the outermost "layer", or the boundary containing the area of the shape.

        <p>
            When we say geometry here, what we mean is the properties of the surface, that do not change 
            under deformations- what are these? 
        </p>
        <p>Topological deformations generally refer to one or more of following processes</p>
