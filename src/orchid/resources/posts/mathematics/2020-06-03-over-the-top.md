        Now, this isn't a comprehensive writeup of the entirety of the field of topology,
        just a definition of the word, and also, 
        <i>topological deformations, such as gluing and tearing
        </i>
        and what they mean, so that you can keep your conceptual orientation the next time you stumble upon this term, and the adjacent ones.

            One can think of topology as a tool, in the same toolbox as geometry.
            Given the geometric object above, when we talk about it's topology,
            <i>
                what particularly concerns us, is it's
                surface, and the properties of it that don't change under continuous deformations.</i>
                When we talk about it's geometry, what we mean is the properties of the surface, that don't change 
                under deformations, the most important of which, is <i>curvature</i>.
        </p>
        <div style="font-size: 18px;font-style:bold;margin-bottom:10px;">So what exactly is a deformation?</div>
        <div style="font-size: 18px;font-style:bold;margin-bottom:10px;">Topological deformations generally refer to one or more of following processes</div>
    </div>

### Tearing:

- Somewhat self explanatory, this is the same type of tear that takes place on paper- remember folding paper up and cutting parts out to make snowflakes? That was a topological deformation, in a sense. You couldn't have gone from the paper to the snowflake without making a destructive change.
### Gluing: 
- An example of gluing would be rolling a piece of paper up into a tube, and then sealing the sides up. Now you've performed gluing, or the connection of some points or edges of a shape- and made another destructive change, by combining
multiple aspects of a shape into a single one.
### Stretching: 
- Just your regular old, every day, familiar, rubber-band style stretching.
### Twisting:
- Again, an every day process (though perhaps figuratively more than literally), seen in bread ties, ribbons, and of course, rubber bands.
### Bending:
- Another familiar process. We've all bent plenty of stuff before.
<p>
    What's important to note here, is that we generally ignore <b>Tearing</b> and <b>Gluing</b>, because these are destructive changes to a surface.

    And there you have it: a cursory understanding of topology- a very fancy way to think about changes in shapes, that can be applied in many fields, from biology, to technology, and
    of course physics, to great effect.
