- [[Principles of Chaos Engineering]]
- #systems-engineering #CE
- # Abstract:
    - ## __Advances in large scale, distributed systems are changing the nature of software engineering.__
    - ## __How much confidence can we have in the complex systems that we put into production?__
    - ## Even when all of the individual components of a (distributed) system are working correctly, the interactions can be unpredictable.
        - This is #emergent-behavior.
    - ## Unpredictable behavior, and real-world events that can affect production environments, can make distributed systems chaotic.
    - ## Weaknesses should be identified before they manifest unexpected behavior throughout the system.
    - ## System Weaknesses could be:
        - ### Improper fallback (failover) settings when a service becomes unavailable.
        - ### Retry storms from improperly tuned timeouts.
        - ### Outages when downstream dependencies receive too much traffic.
        - ### Cascade failures when a [#SPOF]([[#Single-Point-Of-Failure]]) goes down.
    - ## __An empirical systems-based approach to managing the__ **__chaos__** __in distributed systems will build confidence in their ability to withstand realistic conditions.__
- # Chaos In Practice
    - ## __To specifically address the uncertainty, we use experiments that follow four steps:__
        - ## Start by defining #steady-state as some measurable output of a system that indicates it is healthy.
        - ## Hypothesize that this steady state will continue in both the control and experiment group.
        - ## Introduce variables that reflect real world effects, such as crashes, hard drive failures, severed network connections.
        - ## Try and disprove the hypothesis by looking for a difference in the  steady-state group, and the experimental group.
    - ## __The harder it is to disrupt the steady-state, the more confident we can be in the behavior of the system.__
    - ## __If a weakness is exposed, you have a target for improving, and thus increasing the resiliency of your system.__

    - ## "**Vary Real-World Events.**"
    - ## "**Run Experiments in Production.**"
    - ## "**Automate Experiments to Run Continuously**"
    - ## "**Minimize Blast Radius**"
    - # __The above/following principles describe an ideal application of Chaos Engineering, and the degree to which they are applied strongly correlates to the confidence we can have in a distributed system.__
        - ## **Build a Hypothesis around Steady State Behavior.**
            - Focus on the measurable output of a system, rather than the internal attributes- measurements of a systems output over time constitute a proxy for the system's steady-state.
                - $$SB = f(O,\; T)$$.
            - The system's throughput (IOPS), error rates, #latency-percentiles, could all be metrics of interest for representing steady-state behavior.
            - ### __By focusing on system behavior patterns, [#CE]([[#chaos-engineering]]) verifies that a system__ **__does__** __work, rather than validating __**__how__** it works.
            - 
        - ## **Vary Real-World Events.**
            - Chaos variables should reflect real-world events.
            - Prioritize events by potential impact, or frequency.
            - Consider events that correspond to to hardware failures.
            - __Any event capable of disrupting a steady state system is a potential chaos variable.__
        - ## **Run Experiments in Production.**
            - Systems behave differently depending on environment and traffic.
            - The only traffic that can properly mimic the randomness of real traffic is real traffic.
            - To guarantee authenticity in both the experiment and relevance to the current system, prefer testing on production traffic.
        - ## **Automate Experiments to Run Continuously**
            - Running experiments manually is labor intensive, and doesn't scale.
            - #CE builds automated experimentation into the system to drive both orchestration and analysis.
        - ## **Minimize Blast Radius**
            - Experimenting on production can affect user experience. 
            - While there must be some allowance for short term negative impact, ensure that the fallout from experiments are properly contained and mitigated.
