    <h3 class="ttf spacing">At some point, as I child, I stumbled across a definition of 'system', that seemed to describe everything.</h3>
    <h3 class="ttf spacing">Since I don't remember that <i>specific</i> definition, we'll have to make do with the following:</h3>
    <blockquote class="spacing blockquote">
        A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts which can be natural or human-made. Every system is bounded by space and time, influenced by its environment, defined by its structure and purpose, and expressed through its functioning. A system may be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or emergent behavior.

        Faced with the choice between 
        <ul style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;">
            <li class="dib li-font"> 
                <h4 class="bullet-font dib">a</h4>: This definition of a system is wrong.
            </li>
            <li class="dib li-font"> 
                <h4 class="bullet-font dib">b</h4>: Everything is a system.
            </li>
        </ul>
    I chose (and still choose) the latter.
