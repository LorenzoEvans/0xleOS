    <h3 class="ttf spacing">At some point, as I child, I stumbled across a definition of 'system', that seemed to describe everything.</h3>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        Faced with the choice between: 
        <ul style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;">
            <li class="dib li-font"> 
                <h4 class="bullet-font dib">a</h4>- This definition of a system is wrong.
            </li>
            <li class="dib li-font"> 
                <h4 class="bullet-font dib">b</h4>- Everything is a system.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose (and still choose) the latter, so I've had a healthy personal relationship to systems for a while, looking at scales as systems for producing melodies, music groups as systems for producing, well music, and on a more colloquial level, gaming 'systems', which we unknowingly referred to with an incorrect bifurcation: by system, we meant the games, discs, culture and canons, but we weren't really thinking about the actual mechanical/software systems that underlaid them, or we discarded them as entirely separate (yet still somehow appreciating resolution quality, backwards-compatibility and framerate).

        So, with this background, you can imagine my surprise, after venturing into programming, at finding out that there existed a whole school of thought for <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/SYSTHEOR.html">thinking about, analyzing and creating systems</a>, and all this, related to their inputs and outputs too. I also felt (and still feel) rather validated about a way of thinking that tended to come off as peculiar, or perhaps unnecessarily detailed to others- often being told by adults to 'get to the point', and made to feel as if my explanations 'touched on too many things'. Neither me nor the adults, friends, or coworkers I was around realized that I was <i>trying to wrangle with, and <strong>reduce complexity</strong></i>.

    <h3 class="ttf spacing">Anyway, since I don't remember that <i>specific</i> definition, we'll have to make do with Wikipedia's:</h3>
    <blockquote class="spacing blockquote">
        A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts which can be natural or human-made. Every system is bounded by space and time, influenced by its environment, defined by its structure and purpose, and expressed through its functioning. A system may be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or emergent behavior.
    </blockquote>

    This, while more verbose than the definition that changed my thinking as a kid, is pretty much the perspective from which I am most comfortable approaching things, because I think it's the most 'zoomed out' perspective you can take on anything, and many things, like the elephant, become dangerously unrecognizable if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoWRs7lXtYE">look too closely</a>.

    Now, having swan dived into tech, I'd read about many sub-types of systems, mainly operating systems, decentralized/distributed networks, and database management systems, but it wasn't until March of this year, when I started studying for my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification (which I earned last Thursday, w00t!), that I began to really explore the abstract concept of systems.
